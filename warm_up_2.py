CODE NEXT CONNECT - PYTHON ON THE PI CLUB - WARM-UP 2
Challenges
1. Create and call a Python program that acts as a mad lib.
   It should get input from the user of at least 3 different
   words and return a short story back incorporating the userâ€™s
   responses. You will need the input() method.


2. Create and call a Python function that uses the sleep method
   in the time module to switch off printing a happy and sad face
   in a continuous loop. (Hint: The following line of code will
   clear the terminal from the previous print statement:
   print("\033c", end="")

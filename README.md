# python_pi_club
This is the repo for the Code Next Connect club - Python on the Pi
You will need a Raspberry Pi (3, 4, 400) and a Sense HAT unit.

## Install libraries
In your Terminal, run these commands to install the necessary libraries:

#### Sense Hat
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install sense-hat
$ sudo reboot

```
#### Anvil
```bash
$ sudo pip install anvil-uplink

```

## What's in the Repo?
Starter files for the Python on Pi Club, as well as fully-built examples. There are also some warm-ups and basic challenges.

## Memory
The first game, introduced in session 1. The objective is to reproduce the sequence of the arrows by moving the Sense HAT joystick. The game should increase in difficulty with each level by adding more steps to the sequence. 

#### Extensions
- Add more animations.
- Play sound when the user guesses right, or loses game, for example (must wear headphones, or connect to a TV/monitor).

CODE NEXT CONNECT - PYTHON ON THE PI CLUB - WARM-UP 3
Challlenges
1. Write a Python program that generates a random number and asks the user
   to guess the number. The program should let us know whether or not the guess
   was correct or not and what the right answer was.
   
2. Expand on Challenge 1. Use a loop to give the user 3 chances to guess. When
   an incorrect answer is given a “high” or “low” response should be given
   accordingly.
